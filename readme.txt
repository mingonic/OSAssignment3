Specific Contribution:
- We did pair programming. 

Instructions to compile:
- On bluenose server type: gcc a3.c -o a3 -pthread
- Run the executable (a3) that was created: ./a3
- Program will ask to enter in number of patients. 
- Based on number of patients entered, program will run until all patients have finished treatment.

Other notes: 
- Since it is difficult to screenshot entire output of program, 
screenshot of first and last parts of the output have been taken. 
- Screenshot contains program with 5 patients.
